#--->print(object,sep,end,file,flush)
print has 5 parameters
# object -->the value to be printed is object
# sep--> seperator
# Eg
# a = 8
# b = 9
# c = 89
# print(a, b,c, sep='$')
# end --> which is used to add the string at the end of the value,
# # It will not keep the command to stay in same line
# Eg:
# print(str(a), b, end='%%')
# print(str(c))
